 <h1>Helloo world!! </h1> 
 <p>I am Yashika, learning to build real things with code. This is my first real project! I named it Yashika's learning log, to show my journey and creations- what steps I took right, wrong or even unnecessary ones. Explore my journey with me. I'm excited -are you?! </p>

            <li><strong>May 24, 2025: </strong> The first realization hit â€” I have a lot of free time. Why not use it well and start building something real or learning something new?</li>
            <li><strong>May 25, 2025:</strong> Started exploring courses and completed a short course on C#.</li>
            <li><strong>May 26, 2025:</strong> Built my first webpage using HTML and CSS. Learned how to style pages and link external files.</li>
